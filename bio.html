        <p>
            During undergrad, I studied psychology and public health leading me 
            to a fulfilling career in HIV/AIDS prevention. It was at this time I 
            was exposed to SQL and my passion for answering abstract questions and
             using the answers to make important decisions intersected with my interest
              in technology. 
            <br><br>
            I loved that the tech field allowed me to use my creativity to develop 
            solutions and I decided to pursue the exciting opportunity to study software
             development with Generation USA. I am currently developing my technical skills 
             and looking forward to the opportunity to combine my interpersonal communication
              skills gained from my social science background, to collaborate with others on 
              web development projects.
